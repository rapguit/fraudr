== Running the service
RESTful Notes is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to build the project.

In root dir of project:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw package

----

Once the build is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run

----

Alternatively, you can build in a docker container:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker build -t rapguit/fraudr:v1 .
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 rapguit/fraudr:v1
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/index/http-response.adoc[]

*Reponse Fields*
